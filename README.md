# WBSCD Pathfinder Framework (FX)

The WBCSD Pathfinder Framework is a Microsoft based set of code samples and documentation for building a WBCSD PACT conformant Pathfinder application. Specifically, an implementation of the [2.1.0](https://wbcsd.github.io/tr/2023/data-exchange-protocol-20231207/) PCF Data Exchange protocol specification API and example client applications.

The code samples are built using the following Microsoft technologies:

- [dotnet core 8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)
- [ASP.NET Core 8](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/?view=aspnetcore-8.0)
- [Entity Framework Core 8](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/)
- [OpenIddict](https://documentation.openiddict.com)
- [Microsoft Entra Id](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/microsoft-entra)
- [Microsoft Power Platform](https://powerplatform.microsoft.com/en-us/)

See the [FAQ](./docs/faq.md) for more information about the Pathfinder Framework and what conformance to PACT means for the Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability.
